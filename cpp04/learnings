const functions
A function becomes const when the const keyword is used in the functionâ€™s declaration. 
The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are
 called. It is recommended the practice to make as many 
functions const as possible so that accidental changes to objects are avoided.

Virtual functions:
A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation 
provided by the base class

virtual destructor
Every destructor down gets called no matter what. virtual makes sure it starts at the top instead of the middle.
Virtual destructors are useful when you might potentially delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to base class:
