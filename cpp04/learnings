const functions
A function becomes const when the const keyword is used in the functionâ€™s declaration. 
The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are
 called. It is recommended the practice to make as many 
functions const as possible so that accidental changes to objects are avoided.

Virtual functions:
A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation 
provided by the base class

virtual destructor
Every destructor down gets called no matter what. virtual makes sure it starts at the top instead of the middle.
Virtual destructors are useful when you might potentially delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to base class:


deep copies
protected constructor
abstract class

constructors cannot be virtual : A virtual call is a mechanism to get work done given partial information. In particular, "virtual" 
allows us to call a function knowing only any interfaces and not the exact type of the object. To create an object you need complete 
information. In particular, you need to know the exact type of what you want to create. Consequently, a "call to a constructor" 
cannot be virtual.
